## Creating a pull request (PR)

1. Make sure that there is a corresponding issue for your change first.
   If there isn't yet, create one.
2. (If you are not a member of the organization `quarree100`)
   Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.
3. Create a branch off the `master` branch with a meaningful name. Preferably
   include issue number and a few keywords, so that we will have a rough idea
   what the branch refers to, without looking up the issue. As an example:
   `123_some_changes`.
4. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.
5. Create a pull request against the origin's `master` branch. The PR must
   have a meaningful title and a message explaining what was achieved,
   what remains to be done, maybe an example, etc.
6. We will review your PR as time permits. Reviewers may comment on your
   contributions, ask you questions regarding the implementation or request
   changes. If changes are requested, don't start a new PR, push new commits
   to the existing one).
